# Calculator
A calculator in python that uses the tkinter GUI module.  The calculator does integer arithmetic and was a project for my Computer Organization 2 course.  The professor wanted each segment of each digit individually drawn; that is why I went through so much trouble to draw each part of the digit instead of using a simple text view.
